        Happy 2 year anniversary the love of my life, these 730 days have been
        the best in my life and I know it can only get better and better ! I
        remember the day I met you in person for the first time, we’ve already
        been talking for a bit but seeing you I just knew your pictures never
        did justice to how truly beautiful you are. I’ve grown to not only love
        your warm smile, your cute and sweet laugh, your deadly face card never
        declines, I grew to love your heart that is never afraid to love the way
        you do. I grew to fall in love with you, more and more everyday. Our
        relationship has show that true love does exist and every time I look
        into your eyes I fall deeper and deeper in love with you. Our kids
        already have the best mother in the whole universe, I already have the
        best wife in every universe Thank youu my love, and cheers to many more
        years to us
